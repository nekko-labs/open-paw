## 1. Install

**Download a build** for your platform from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/nekko-labs/open-paw/releases/latest):

| Platform | Artifact |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `Open Paw-<version>-x64.exe` (NSIS installer) |
| macOS | `Open Paw-<version>-<arch>.dmg` (Apple Silicon & Intel) |
| Linux | `.AppImage` or `.deb` |

**Or run from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nekko-labs/open-paw
cd open-paw
npm install
npm run dev          # launches the desktop app
```

Open Paw stores everything locally (under your OS app-data dir): settings,
sessions, memory, and a usage log. No account, no telemetry.

---

## 2. Connect a model

Open the **Models** tab. This is where Open Paw differs from most tools — local
model servers are first-class, not an afterthought.

![Models tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nekko-labs/open-paw/main/docs/screenshots/models.png)

- **Auto-discover local** probes `localhost:11434` (Ollama), `:1234` (LM Studio),
  and `:8000` (vLLM). Anything running is added with one click.
- **Add provider** lets you configure a server manually, or add a cloud provider —
  Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (just paste the
  base URL + key).
- For **Ollama**, you can **pull** new models and **load / unload** them into memory
  right from the card.
- The **Token usage** panel charts input/output tokens over time and breaks them
  down per model and per provider.

> Tip: set a default provider + model in Settings so new chats start ready to go.

### Example: connect an LM Studio server

1. In LM Studio, load a model and start its server (Developer → Start Server).
2. In Open Paw: **Add provider → LM Studio**, set the **Base URL** to your server,
   e.g. `http://10.5.0.2:1338` (you can paste just `host:port` — Nekko appends
   `/v1` automatically). No API key needed.
3. **Test connection** → the model dropdown fills with whatever LM Studio is serving.
4. Pick the model in the chat header and go.

**Reasoning models** (Gemma, DeepSeek-R1, Qwen-thinking, etc.) are first-class:
their chain-of-thought streams into a collapsible **Thinking** block above the
answer, so you see progress during long reasoning and the answer stays clean.

---

## 3. The unified chat

The **Chat** tab is the heart of the app. There are no separate "chat", "cowork",
and "code" modes — it's one thread. Ask a question, or hand off a task and let
Nekko act on your machine through tools (read / write / edit files, glob, grep,
list dirs, run shell commands).

![Unified chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nekko-labs/open-paw/main/docs/screenshots/chat.png)

- Pick the **provider and model** from the header dropdowns at any time.
- Assistant messages render **markdown and code**; every **tool call** the model
  makes shows up as a card so you can see exactly what it did.
- Streaming is live; hit **Stop** to abort a turn.

**Keyboard shortcuts** — Open Paw has a command palette (think Cmd-K everywhere):

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + K` | Open the command palette |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + N` | New chat |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + \` | Toggle the context panel |

## 4. The Context Inspector

The right-hand panel (toggle it with the panel icon) is Open Paw's signature
feature. It shows **exactly what is entering the prompt this turn**, grouped by
where it came from:

- **Guidelines** — `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules` detected in your
  workspace folders
- **Files** — anything you've attached
- **Memory** — relevant global / per-project notes
- **Connectors** — issues, messages, or docs pulled in from Linear/Slack/etc.

Each item shows a **token estimate**, can be **toggled off** to exclude it, or
**pinned** to always include it. The bar at the top shows how much of the model's
context window you're using. No more guessing what the model "saw" — you can see
and shape it.

---

## 5. Guardrails & sandbox

Open **Settings**. Two layers keep Nekko from doing something you didn't intend.

![Guardrails & sandbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nekko-labs/open-paw/main/docs/screenshots/guardrails.png)

**Sandbox mode** controls how the agent may touch your machine:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace jail *(default)* | File access confined to your added folders |
| Ask everything | Every write or command requires approval |
| Docker | Run shell commands inside a container if Docker is present |
| Off | No restrictions (power users) |

**Guardrails** classify risky shell commands and decide whether to **allow**, **ask**,
or **deny** — per rule, each toggleable. Ships with sensible defaults: recursive
force-delete, raw disk writes, `git push --force`, `curl | sh`, privilege
escalation, secret/`.env` access, and more. When a command matches an "ask" rule,
the chat shows an **approval bar** with the exact command and its severity before
anything runs.

---

## 6. Projects & the codebase index

The **Projects** tab manages your workspace folders — and yes, **multiple roots**
are supported. Each folder is indexed for files and code symbols (functions,
classes, interfaces, types) so the agent and search have a fast map of your code.

![Projects & index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nekko-labs/open-paw/main/docs/screenshots/projects.png)

- **Add** a folder and it indexes in the background.
- See **file + symbol counts** and index status per project.
- **Search** across the indexed files instantly, or browse the file list with
  per-file symbol counts.

---

## 7. Memory

The **Memory** tab is a simple, durable knowledge base stored as plain markdown.
Keep **global** memories (preferences, conventions) and **per-project** memories.
Relevant entries are surfaced in the Context Inspector and injected automatically,
so Nekko remembers how you like to work across sessions.

---

## 8. Connectors

The **Connectors** tab links external sources so their content can be pulled into
context: **Linear**, **Slack**, **Discord** (token-based), and **Gmail** /
**Google Drive** (OAuth). Tokens are stored locally. Connect one, fetch a sample
to confirm it works, and the results become available to the assistant.

---

## 9. The mascot

**Nekko** is the 8-bit cat that lives at the edge of the window. It waves to say
hello, peeks in from the side, and **"makes cat biscuits"** (kneads its paws) while
the model is thinking. Don't want it? Toggle it off in Settings → Appearance.
