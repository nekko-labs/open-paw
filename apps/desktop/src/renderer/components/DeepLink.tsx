/**
 * `kotrain://` links from other apps.
 *
 * One route today: `kotrain://hypergate/connect?port=7777`, which is what
 * Hypergate's "Connect Kotrain" button fires. The link is a *request*, never
 * the action: any program on the machine can open a URL, and connecting a
 * gateway means trusting whatever tools it offers in every chat from then on.
 * So the link brings the window forward, names what is asking, and waits for a
 * click. Everything it shows is read back from the daemon itself rather than
 * taken from the URL, which carries nothing but a port.
