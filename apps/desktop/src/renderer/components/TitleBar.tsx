 * The window's title bar, drawn by the app.
 *
 * One strip in the app's own background colour: the wordmark at the leading
 * edge, empty space the rest of the way, and the OS buttons landing in that
 * space rather than in a frame of their own. Dragging it moves the window and
 * double-clicking it maximises, both handled by Chromium through the
 * `app-region` rules in `styles.css`.
 *
 * The wordmark lives here rather than in the rail so it isn't shown twice; the
 * rail keeps it for the web and phone builds, which have no strip to put it in.
 *
 * Renders nothing outside the desktop shell.
