/**
 * macOS GPU statistics, parsed out of `ioreg`.
 *
 * There is no `nvidia-smi` on a Mac, and the tool that reports real GPU power and
 * residency, `powermetrics`, needs root, and no monitoring chip is worth a sudo
 * prompt. The accelerator driver publishes its own counters in the IO registry
 * instead, and any user can read them:
 *
 *   ioreg -r -d 1 -w 0 -c IOAccelerator
 *
 * Each accelerator entry carries a `PerformanceStatistics` dictionary holding
 * `Device Utilization %` (the same 0-100 figure `nvidia-smi` reports) and the
 * driver's current allocation in bytes. Apple Silicon has no discrete VRAM, so
 * the allocation is a slice of the unified pool; the caller pairs it with system
 * RAM as the total and flags the reading as unified.
 *
 * The registry's text form is stable and one key/value per line, so it is parsed
 * directly rather than by pulling in a plist reader for the `-a` XML variant.
 * Parsing lives here, apart from the process spawn, so it can be tested against a
 * captured dump.
