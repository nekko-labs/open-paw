/**
 * Fit-planning types: what we know about a model, what the machine has, and the
 * projection that answers "will this fit, where will it run, and why".
 *
 * The math lives in @kotrain/core (pure, no I/O). These are the contracts that
 * travel between it, the host adapters that gather the facts, and the renderer
 * that draws the result.
 *
 * Every optional field is optional on purpose. A missing field means the planner
 * answers `unknown` rather than inventing a number, which matters more here than
 * anywhere else in the app: a confident wrong VRAM figure costs the user a long
 * load and their trust in every figure after it.
