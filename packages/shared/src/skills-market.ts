/**
 * Skills marketplace: a curated catalog of installable skills, browsable from
 * the Skills tab. Skills come from three shelves:
 *
 *  - **Nekko Labs**, first-party skills we author and maintain.
 *  - **Popular online**, well-known community skills (Anthropic's official
 *    skills repo, popular open-source skill packs), ranked by their public
 *    metrics (GitHub stars / installs). The catalog ships as a curated,
 *    offline-first snapshot so the marketplace works with no internet.
 *  - **Installed**, what the user has installed, and where.
 *
 * A skill can be installed into **Kotrain** itself (it joins the `/` menu and
 * the Skills tab) or exported to another agent app that reads the SKILL.md
 * convention (Claude Code `~/.claude/skills`, Codex `~/.codex/skills`).
