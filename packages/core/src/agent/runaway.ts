 * forever ("Let me start building this feature now." x2534 was one observed
 * case, 108k characters of reasoning in a single reply). Nothing upstream stops
 * that on its own: the server happily streams until the context window fills,
 * every token crosses IPC into the renderer, and the reply neither finishes nor
 * fails. A per-stream output cap (see MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_DEFAULT) bounds the
 * damage, but it still means minutes of dead waiting.
 *
 * This guard watches a stream as it arrives and reports the moment the output
 * has collapsed into a cycle, so the caller can cut the stream off and tell the
 * user what happened instead of letting the reply hang.
