 * Picking a run back up after it stopped part-way.

 * because the last one timed out is the difference between "carry on" and "start
 * the whole thing again". The host checkpoints each step to disk as it lands and
 * the loop keeps the text of a reply that was cut off, so what survives an
 * interruption is a real transcript. It just isn't always a *valid* one: a run
 * killed between the model asking for a tool and the tool answering leaves a
 * request with no result, which every provider rejects.
 *
 * Repairing that gap is what lets the same transcript be sent again.
