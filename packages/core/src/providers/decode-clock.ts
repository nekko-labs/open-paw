/**
 * Times the decode phase of one streamed response, for the tokens/second figure.
 *
 * Throughput is tokens divided by the time spent *generating* them. The wall
 * clock of a turn is not that: it also covers queueing, prompt processing (which
 * on a local model with a long context can be most of the wait), the tool calls
 * the agent runs between responses, and any approval the user sat on. Dividing
 * by that gives a number several times below what the runtime itself reports,
 * which is what made Kotrain's tok/s wrong.
 *
 * So the clock starts at the first generated chunk, not at the request, and
 * stops when usage arrives at the end of the stream. Providers that report their
 * own decode time (Ollama's `eval_duration`) should use that instead: it is
 * measured inside the runtime and excludes transport entirely.
